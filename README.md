## Technicalities

This project was created using Google Colab. Google Colab is a cloud-based platform that allows users to write and execute Python code in a browser. It provides free access to powerful external servers equipped with GPUs and TPUs, enabling faster processing and training of machine learning models compared to standard personal computers. This makes it an ideal tool for running computationally intensive tasks without requiring users to invest in high-end local hardware. Additionally, Colab supports seamless integration with Google Drive for data storage and collaboration. This is useful as we will be producing and then accessing many files that one can save to their own Google Drive account. In order to run this code, you therefore need a Google account.

To download the satellite images for our chosen areas, we use Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud-based geospatial processing platform that enables users to access and analyze vast amounts of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. GEE allows users to efficiently query, filter, and preprocess satelliote imagery‚Äîsuch as selecting specific bands, applying cloud masks, and defining time ranges‚Äîusing Python APIs. This facilitates scalable and efficient remote sensing analysis without the need to download large datasets or manage local storage. A Google Earth Engine account is therefore also required.

All of the libraries, tools and data used (Sentinel-2, Google Colab, Google Earth Engine, CodeCarbon) are free / open source.

The code must be run in sequential order to run the project. There are a few key things to keep in mind:
- Give permissions for the file to access your Google Drive to mount when prompted. This is necessary as it will give you a place to store the images we create.
- Replace the base_path directory and folder_name variables at the start with your own Google Drive directory path and the name of the folder under which you will store the files for this project.
- You will need to create a project titled 'ai4eo-final' in your personal Google Earth Engine account to access the Sentinel-2 imagery we need.

## Description of the problem to be tackled

This project focuses on the application of machine learning techniques, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), to the detection of inland water bodies in Bangladesh using satellite imagery. The motivation behind selecting this topic lies in the increasing global demand for near-real-time environmental monitoring, particularly in densely populated and climate-vulnerable regions (Islam et al, 2019). Inland water body detection has become a critical area of research due to the intensifying impacts of climate change, including rising sea levels, glacial melt, and more frequent extreme weather events, all of which contribute to abnormal and dangerous flooding patterns (IPCC, 2021; Setelle et al, 2014).

Bangladesh was chosen as the focal region due to its unique geographical and climatic conditions. Situated on the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers, and being only a few meters above sea level, Bangladesh is home to one of the most extensive river networks in the world. This makes it especially prone to flooding, even under moderate rainfall conditions (Mirza, 2002). Furthermore, the low elevation and monsoonal climate amplify the risk of inland water expansion during both seasonal and anomalous rainfall events (Rahman and Salehin, 2013).

Adding to the complexity, Bangladesh is a developing country with limited economic resources and infrastructure for widespread, ground-based hydrological monitoring, which is traditionally expensive, labour-intensive, and requires specialist training (Rahman et al., 2019). With a population density exceeding 1,200 people per square kilometer (World Bank, 2022), the social and economic stakes of flood mismanagement are extremely high. Consequently, there is a pressing need for cost-effective, scalable, and automated solutions for water monitoring.

This is where machine learning and remote sensing offer transformative potential. By leveraging open-access satellite data‚Äîsuch as imagery from the Sentinel-2 constellation provided by the European Space Agency (ESA)‚Äîand combining it with supervised and unsupervised learning models, water bodies can be identified, segmented, and monitored in a timely and repeatable manner (Drusch et al., 2012). These models can rapidly process large volumes of image data, enabling near-real-time detection of water extent changes without the need for on-the-ground personnel. This not only reduces the operational cost of monitoring but also empowers early warning systems, urban planning, and climate adaptation efforts in resource-constrained regions like Bangladesh.

We are using 2 different areas of Bangladesh for testing and training the data, but by changing the coordinates the code can be applied to any region in Bangladesh. These areas have been chosen due to their complex river systems with seasonal tributaries, which will test how effective the models are at analysing data patterns for accurate prediction.

## Description of techniques used

### Sentinel-2 Imagery

<img width="532" alt="Figure describing how S2 imagery works" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4d3d0fc-f929-40f9-856f-7bc3e5ff763a" />

The Sentinel-2 mission, part of the European Union‚Äôs Copernicus Programme, consists of a pair of satellites‚ÄîSentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B‚Äîequipped with the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), which captures Earth‚Äôs surface in 13 spectral bands ranging from visible to short-wave infrared at varying spatial resolutions (10 m, 20 m, and 60 m) (Drusch et al., 2012). The high revisit frequency (every 5 days at the equator) and rich spectral data make Sentinel-2 especially suitable for environmental monitoring applications, including inland water detection. In this context, we use the bands Green (Band 3), Near-Infrared (Band 8), and Short-Wave Infrared (Band 11) to calculate the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), which enhances the contrast between water bodies and other land features (McFeeters, 1996). The NDWI index can therefore be used to produce very accurate water masks (which detect which areas are water and which areas are land) for the region. This provides the basis to create both training data for the supervised models, and a 'correct' water mask for the test data that we can compare the model results to (ie. we are checking how close the model prediction is to the NDWI result; the closer the prediction, the more accurate the model is assessed to be). For more information on how the NDWI is utilised in this project, please refer to the Google Colab notebook.

### Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression and Random Forest

![Figure describing supervised learning techniques used](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c319162d-ddcb-4f10-b1c5-21153fcd8458)

Logistic regression is a supervised classification algorithm that models the probability of a binary outcome based on input features. In the context of inland water detection, the input features are Sentinel-2 RGB bands. This provides a satellite-like image to test the model. The logistic model uses the logistic (sigmoid) function to map the input feature space to a probability between 0 and 1, with a defined threshold (e.g., 0.5) used to classify pixels as water or non-water (Hosmer et al., 2013). This method is simple, interpretable, and computationally efficient. However, its performance is limited when the relationship between input features and the target class is nonlinear or more complex (Hosmer et al, 2013).

Random forest is an ensemble-based supervised learning algorithm that constructs a large number of decision trees during training and outputs the mode of their predictions for classification tasks (Breiman, 2001). Each decision tree is built from a random subset of training data and features, which helps reduce overfitting and improve generalization. In water body detection, random forest is well-suited to handle the complex, nonlinear relationships between spectral bands and water presence. For instance, subtle variations in vegetation or soil reflectance near riverbanks can be better captured through the ensemble voting mechanism, typically resulting in higher classification accuracy compared to simpler models like logistic regression (Belgiu and DrƒÉgu≈£, 2016).

### Unsupervised Learning: K-Means Clustering

<img width="507" alt="Figure describing how the unsupervised techniques used work" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5f9e747-db90-4797-8fae-ab70bfe7accc" />

K-means is an unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data into a predefined number of clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster (MacQueen, 1967). When applied to satellite imagery, pixel values (e.g., RGB reflectance or NDWI values) are grouped into clusters based on spectral similarity.

For inland water body detection, a K-means model with ùëò=2 can be used to segment pixels into water and non-water classes without requiring labeled training data. While less accurate than supervised methods due to lack of ground truth guidance, K-means can be useful in rapid assessments or regions lacking labeled datasets (Pekel et al, 2016).

## Environmental cost of this research project

We are using the CodeCarbon Python library to track the environmental cost of this code. CodeCarbon is a lightweight, open-source Python library designed to estimate the carbon footprint of code execution. By tracking the energy consumed by computing resources (CPU, GPU, RAM) and considering the location‚Äôs energy grid carbon intensity, CodeCarbon provides an estimate of the environmental impact of running a particular script or model (Hanna, 2022). This is especially useful for tracking and comparing the CO2 emissions of the different machine learning algorithms we use in this project, as training models can be computationally intensive. 

Running machine learning code, particularly in cloud-based environments and on high-performance GPUs such as those offered on Google Colab, can lead to significant carbon emissions‚Äîdepending on the energy source powering the data center. In this project, a T4 GPU was used. This has a thermal design power (TDP) of approximately 70 watts. This is relatively energy-efficient compared to higher-end GPUs like the A100 or V100, which can exceed 250‚Äì300 watts for a trade-off of better GPU performance - however, higher GPU performance is clearly not necessary for this project, so a more energy-effective GPU was the correct choice. 

The CodeCarbon results showed that in total, the project consumed 0.021479 kg CO2eq. This indicates a very low environmental impact‚Äîroughly equivalent to charging a smartphone a few times or driving a car about 100 meters. This is likely due to the efficiency of the code (for example, we used the same cell to train the data for both the logistic regression and the random forest models), and the fact that it was performed on a relatively small area. This shows how small-scale machine learning tasks can be environmentally sustainable. As such, when classifying water bodies in Bangladesh, it would be environmentally responsible to focus on areas that are particularly vulnerable (ie. that have both a high flooding risk and a population living near that risk), rather than attempting to use these models on the whole of Bangladesh. 

Furthermore, when comparing the techniques used, it was found that unsupervised learning emitted much less CO2 than supervised learning techniques (logistic regression emissions account for 64.4 times the emissions from k-means classification). This is because it requires relatively large amount of energy to train the models. However, once the models are trained, they can be used indefinitely without having to re-train them. Therefore, for higher accuracy, logistic regression may be preffered when labelled data is available as it had the lowest misclassification rate and a much lower environmental impact to run the actual model on unseen data compared to random forest (emissions from training the data accounts for 95.1% of the emissions from logistic regression; random forest emissions account for 3.2 times the emissions from logistic regression). Overall, K-Means is an environmentally friendly option for unlabelled data (5.43E-05 kg CO2eq), and Logistic Regression (0.000171325741 kg CO2eq) is still a relatively environmentally friendly option, especially when compared to Random Forest (0.007931305931 kg CO2eq). 

Another way to further mitigate environmental impact is by running code in regions powered by renewable energy to significantly cut emissions. The CodeCarbon csv output files show that when I ran this code (May 2025), the servers used to run it were located in The Netherlands (europe-west4 on Google Cloud). This is a relatively sustainable option for cloud computing, benefiting from carbon-aware scheduling and a growing share of renewable energy. However, it is not as environmentally optimal as regions like Finland or Sweden, which operate on grids powered largely by clean energy sources such as hydroelectricity. For minimizing carbon emissions, choosing data center regions in Northern Europe and Northeast North America‚Äîsuch as Google Cloud‚Äôs Finland (europe-north1) offers a greener alternative. For example, Finland's grid carbon intensity (gCO2eq/kWh) is over 5x lower than The Netherland's (Google Cloud, 2023). Within Colab Enterprise, you can choose the region where your Colab notebook and its associated runtime are located; however, this requires purchasing Colab Pro, so is a less accessible option.
